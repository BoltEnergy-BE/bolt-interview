# Case 1

1. Create a duplication of the `Origin` page, create a new route for it and add a navigation item on the homepage
2. Use the Bolt Design System components that can be found in the `design-system` folder (limited set). Props and usage can be found in the [documentation](https://rebranding.design-system.boltenergie.be).
3. Save the form values in a state.
4. Validate the form before submission and show the error for each invalid field. (DS components have an error prop)
   - All fields are required.
   - Email should be the correct pattern. (You can use EMAIL_REGEX from the constants folder)
5. Add a loading state when submitting the form. (Button component has a prop for the visual confirmation)
6. Pop a success or error message using The Toast component. ([documentation](https://rebranding.design-system.boltenergie.be/?path=/docs/components-toast--docs))
7. Optimize where you think it is needed or necessary.
